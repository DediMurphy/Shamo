# Full-Stack Laravel Flutter 2021: Building E-Commerce and Chat Applications

## Information
In this course, I build an e-commerce application using the PHP Laravel framework and Flutter SDK. Laravel simplifies the development of complex e-commerce applications, making them faster and easier. Additionally, Flutter, with its cross-platform capabilities, allows developers to integrate e-commerce across platforms such as iOS and Android.

APIs created using the Laravel framework will facilitate users' shopping experience on e-commerce platforms. Through a case study of the Online Shoe Store application, exploring important features such as application settings, user feedback, and transactions.
